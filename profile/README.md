## Welcome to CNC4ME - Where Programmer/Machinist meets Open-Source

### Things to See üîç 
Visit our [blog](https://blog.cnc4me.org/) about the development of the [Fanuc Macro Playground](https://playground.cnc4me.org/). That is a work-in-progress on a full implementation of a CNC machine's execution enviromnent. The work is based off of a Matsuura G-Tech 30i, with the end goal of running and debugging a complete program. Some of the features include:
 - Macro Variable Assignment
 - Macro Functions (ABS, ROUND, TAN, etc...)
 - Brackets and PEMDAS evaluation of terms
 - G10 line evaluation for Tools and Offsets
 - More to come....
